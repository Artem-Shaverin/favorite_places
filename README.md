# Favorite Places App

A mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to save and organize their favorite places. The app enables users to add a new place by providing a title, taking a photo with the camera, and selecting a location via current geolocation or an interactive map. Each place is stored in a persistent database for future access, with detailed views showing the photo, address, and location on a map. The app integrates native device features such as camera usage and geolocation to offer a smooth and user-friendly experience.
